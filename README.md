# WASM Game Of Life

## WIP:

This is the Rust/Wasm 'Game Of Life' project from a tutorial you can find here: [https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).

This project was generated from a template provided by the tutorial, so the web client is a submodule. You can find the client here: [https://github.com/mdouglasbrett/wasm-game-of-life-client](https://github.com/mdouglasbrett/wasm-game-of-life-client). I may completely split this out at some point.
